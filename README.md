# Data Cleaning Project 

## In this project I use SQL to clean up data from an imported CSV file. 
### Populated Property Address which was then broken down into Address, City, and State. 
### Changed out values to make it streamlined throughout the dataset 
### Deleted duplicate rows using CTEs 
### Deleted unused columns
